# Mobile Job Application Platform - Comprehensive Architecture Design

## 1. High-Level System Architecture
### Architecture Style: Microservices with Serverless Components
The platform will adopt a microservices architecture with serverless components to ensure:
- High scalability
- Flexible deployment
- Independent service evolution
- Cost-effective resource utilization

## 2. Technology Stack Recommendations

### 2.1 Mobile Application
**Framework:** React Native
- **Rationale:** 
  - Cross-platform development (iOS and Android)
  - Code reusability (up to 90%)
  - Strong community support
  - Performance close to native apps
  - Easy integration with backend APIs

**Key Libraries:**
- React Navigation for routing
- Redux for state management
- Formik for form handling
- React Native Document Picker for CV uploads
- React Native Firebase for authentication

### 2.2 Backend Infrastructure
**Framework:** Node.js with NestJS
- **Rationale:**
  - TypeScript support
  - Modular architecture
  - Dependency injection
  - Built-in validation
  - Easy microservices integration

**Microservices Breakdown:**
1. User Service
2. Profile Service
3. Job Matching Service
4. Notification Service
5. Authentication Service

### 2.3 Database Strategy
**Primary Database:** PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM)
- **Purpose:** Structured job seeker and job data
- Strong ACID compliance
- Advanced indexing for search performance

**NoSQL Database:** MongoDB
- **Purpose:** Flexible job matching metadata
- Scalable document storage
- Efficient for AI-driven matching algorithms

**Caching Layer:** Redis
- Session management
- Temporary data storage
- Rapid retrieval of frequent queries

### 2.4 Authentication
**Authentication Provider:** Firebase Authentication
- **Features:**
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Social media login integration
  - Secure token-based authentication
  - Built-in email verification

### 2.5 File Storage
**Solution:** Google Cloud Storage
- Secure PDF storage
- Scalable file management
- Easy integration with other Google Cloud services
- Automated backup and versioning

### 2.6 AI Job Matching
**Technology Stack:**
- Python-based machine learning microservice
- TensorFlow for recommendation model
- Scikit-learn for initial filtering
- Hugging Face transformers for semantic matching

### 2.7 API Gateway
**Solution:** Kong API Gateway
- Request routing
- Rate limiting
- Authentication validation
- Monitoring and analytics

## 4. Security Best Practices
- JWT token-based authentication
- HTTPS everywhere
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular security audits
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

## 5. Performance Optimization
- Implement GraphQL for efficient data fetching
- Use server-side caching with Redis
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Optimize database queries
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement lazy loading in mobile app

## 6. Deployment Strategy
**Containerization:** Docker
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes
**Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Scaling Approach
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Serverless functions for event-driven tasks
- Multi-region deployment
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory utilization

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
**Tools:**
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging
- Sentry for error tracking

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline
**Tools:** GitHub Actions
**Workflow:**
1. Code push triggers
2. Automated testing
3. Static code analysis
4. Docker image build
5. Kubernetes deployment
6. Post-deployment tests

## 9. Data Compliance
- GDPR compliance
- Data minimization principle
- User consent management
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Secure data deletion mechanisms

## 10. Cost Optimization
- Serverless computing for sporadic tasks
- Spot instances for background processing
- Optimize database query performance
- Implement efficient caching strategies

## Estimated Architecture Complexity
- **Estimated Development Time:** 4-6 months
- **Initial Team Size:** 5-7 engineers
- **Estimated Monthly Infrastructure Cost:** $500-$1500

## Future Extensibility
- Modular architecture allows easy feature addition
- Microservices can be independently scaled
- Event-driven architecture supports future integrations
