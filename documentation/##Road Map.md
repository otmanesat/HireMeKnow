##Road Map
1. Discovery Phase
Goal: Validate the idea and set a clear foundation.
Conduct Market Research: Validate demand and study competitors like Indeed or LinkedIn.
Define MVP: Prioritize features (e.g., user registration, job search, application submission).
Gather Requirements: Finalize functional requirements and user stories.
Create a Detailed PRD: Refine the provided PRD with stakeholders.
2. Planning Phase
Goal: Define scope, timelines, and architecture.
Set Development Milestones: Break the project into iterations:
Iteration 1: User registration, profile setup, and basic job search.
Iteration 2: Advanced profiles, job recommendations, and application tracking.
Iteration 3: Recruiter features (job posting, filtering, analytics).
Select Tech Stack:
Frontend: React Native (for cross-platform mobile app).
Backend: NestJS for microservices.
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching.
Authentication: Keycloak or custom JWT-based RBAC.
Design Architecture: Finalize database schemas, API contracts, and microservices interactions.
3. Design Phase
Goal: Ensure seamless user experience and prepare prototypes.
Create UX Wireframes: Map all screens and flows, focusing on simplicity.
Develop UI Mockups: Use tools like Figma to define the visual design.
Prototyping: Build interactive prototypes for onboarding and job search flows.
4. Development Phase
Goal: Build and test MVP features incrementally.
Setup Local Development Environment:
Use Docker Compose for local microservicesâ€‹
.
Configure backend, database, and API gateway.
Implement Core Features (Iteration 1):
User registration with RBAC.
Basic job posting and search functionalities.
Profile setup for job seekers and recruiters.
Enhance Features (Iteration 2):
Add CV builder, advanced job recommendations, and skill assessments.
Implement notification services for job updates.
Develop Recruiter Tools (Iteration 3):
Job posting, candidate filtering, interview management.
Analytics dashboard for recruiter performance.
Test Continuously:
Unit testing (e.g., Jest for NestJS).
Integration testing for API interactions.
Mobile app UI testing using tools like Appium.
5. Transition to Serverless
Goal: Optimize for scalability and cost-efficiency.
Migrate to AWS Lambda/DynamoDB for microservices:
Replace monolithic APIs with serverless functions.
Use S3 for file storage, DynamoDB for dynamic data.
Implement CI/CD Pipelines: Automate deployments to the cloud.
6. Deployment and Monitoring
Goal: Launch and ensure reliability.
Deploy on Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, or GCP based on cost and features.
Set Up Monitoring Tools: Use Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch.
Enable Feedback Loops: Use user behavior analytics to refine features.
7. Post-Launch Optimization
Goal: Iterate and grow the platform.
Analyze Metrics: Focus on user engagement, registration rates, and job matches.
Add Premium Features: Enable monetization via subscription or pay-per-feature.
Scale Infrastructure: Upgrade to handle increased traffic.
User Feedback Cycles: Continuously improve based on user suggestions.
Ideal Iterative Timeline
Month 1-2: Discovery and Planning.
Month 3-4: MVP Development (Core features).
Month 5-6: Enhanced Functionality.
Month 7: Recruiter Features.
Month 8+: Transition to serverless and scaling.
