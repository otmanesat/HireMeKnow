# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline implemented for the HireMeKnow application. The pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment processes across both mobile and backend components.

## Pipeline Structure

### 1. Main Pipeline (`main.yml`)
The main pipeline handles core CI/CD operations:

#### Jobs:
- **Test**: Runs unit and integration tests
- **Lint**: Performs code quality checks
- **Build Android**: Compiles Android application
- **Build iOS**: Compiles iOS application
- **Deploy Backend**: Deploys backend services to AWS

#### Triggers:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch

### 2. Environment Setup (`environment.yml`)
Manages environment configuration across different stages:

#### Features:
- Dynamic environment variable generation
- Stage-specific configurations (dev/prod)
- Secure secrets management

#### Usage:
- Called by main pipeline
- Can be manually triggered
- Creates environment files for both backend and mobile app

### 3. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
Implements security checks and compliance monitoring:

#### Scans:
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection
- License compliance checks
- Security headers verification

#### Schedule:
- Runs on push to main branches
- Weekly scheduled scans

## Required Secrets

### GitHub Secrets
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION
API_URL
FIREBASE_CONFIG
CODECOV_TOKEN
```

## Environment Variables

### Production
```
NODE_ENV=production
STAGE=prod
API_URL=https://api.hiremekow.com
```

### Development
```
NODE_ENV=production
STAGE=dev
API_URL=https://api.dev.hiremekow.com
```

## Deployment Process

### Backend Deployment
1. Tests and linting pass
2. AWS credentials configured
3. CDK deployment executed

### Mobile App Deployment
1. Tests and linting pass
2. Platform-specific builds created
3. Artifacts uploaded for distribution

## Error Handling

### Pipeline Failures
- Immediate team notification
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Detailed error logging

### Security Issues
- Immediate pipeline termination
- Security team notification
- Vulnerability tracking

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Clean lint reports

### Security
- Regular secret rotation
- Weekly security scans
- Compliance monitoring

### Performance
- Build caching
- Parallel job execution
- Optimized test runs

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Weekly security scans
- Dependencies updates
- Performance optimization

### Metrics
- Build success rate
- Deployment frequency
- Security compliance score

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. Build Failures
   - Check dependency versions
   - Verify environment variables
   - Review build logs

2. Test Failures
   - Check test environment
   - Review recent code changes
   - Verify test data

3. Deployment Issues
   - Verify AWS credentials
   - Check service health
   - Review deployment logs

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. Automated rollback procedures
2. Enhanced monitoring
3. Performance optimization
4. Extended test coverage
