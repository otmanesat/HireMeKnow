### **Planning Phase for Your Job Application Platform**

#### **1. Define Objectives and Scope**
**Goal**: Establish clear, actionable objectives for the project and define the boundaries of what will be included in the initial release.  
- **Primary Objectives**:
  - Deliver a mobile-first job application platform for job seekers and recruiters.  
  - Focus on MVP features (registration, profile creation, job search).  
  - Ensure scalability and user-friendly design.  
- **MVP Scope**:
  - User registration with role selection (e.g., Job Seeker, Recruiter).  
  - Profile creation for job seekers and recruiters.  
  - Basic job search and application functionality.

#### **2. Define Deliverables**
**Goal**: Specify key artifacts and outcomes for each stage.  
- **Requirements**:
  - Functional specifications for each user role (from the PRD).  
  - Non-functional requirements (security, scalability, performance).  
- **Design**:
  - Wireframes for core user flows (onboarding, job search, profile setup).  
  - Initial API contracts and database schema diagrams.  
- **Development Setup**:
  - Dockerized development environment for backend and database.  
  - Basic React Native project for mobile app.

#### **3. Choose Tech Stack**
**Goal**: Select tools and technologies that align with the platform's needs.  
- **Frontend**:  
  - **Framework**: React Native (cross-platform compatibility).  
  - **State Management**: Redux or Context API.  
  - **Testing**: Jest, Detox for UI.  
- **Backend**:  
  - **Framework**: NestJS for microservices.  
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational data) and Redis (caching).  
  - **Authentication**: Keycloak for role-based access and OpenID Connect.  
- **Cloud Services** (for later stages):  
  - **Hosting**: AWS Lambda for serverless backend.  
  - **Storage**: S3 for resumes and job assets.  
  - **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana for real-time insights.

#### **4. Create Development Milestones**
**Goal**: Break the project into iterative steps with deadlines.  

| **Milestone**               | **Timeline** | **Deliverables**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Milestone 1**: MVP Setup  | Week 1-3     | User registration, onboarding flow, and profile setup.                          |
| **Milestone 2**: Core Jobs  | Week 4-6     | Job search, job details, and application submission.                            |
| **Milestone 3**: Analytics  | Week 7-8     | Recruiter dashboards, job recommendations, and analytics reporting.             |
| **Milestone 4**: Testing    | Week 9-10    | QA testing, user feedback loops, and iterative bug fixes.                       |
| **Milestone 5**: Launch     | Week 11-12   | Cloud deployment, user onboarding, and soft launch.                             |

#### **5. Develop System Architecture**
**Goal**: Plan the infrastructure and system interactions.  
- **Microservices Architecture**:
  - **Services**: User, Job Matching, Notification, and API Gateway.  
  - **Inter-Service Communication**: RESTful APIs (for MVP), gRPC (for scalability).  
- **Database Design**:
  - Tables: `users`, `jobs`, `applications`, `roles`.  
  - Indexing for fast job searches and matching queries.  
- **API Contracts**:
  - `POST /api/register`: Registers a user.  
  - `GET /api/jobs`: Retrieves job listings with filters.  

---

#### **6. Plan UX Design**
**Goal**: Lay the groundwork for user experience.  
- **User Flows**:
  - Registration → Onboarding → Dashboard.  
  - Job Search → Application Submission → Status Tracking.  
- **Wireframes**:
  - Design simple, intuitive screens for MVP functionalities.  

---

#### **7. Resource Planning**
**Goal**: Allocate team roles and tools.  
- **Team Roles**:
  - **Product Manager**: Oversees scope and milestones.  
  - **Frontend Developer(s)**: Focus on React Native.  
  - **Backend Developer(s)**: Build APIs and services in NestJS.  
  - **UI/UX Designer**: Create wireframes and prototypes.  
  - **QA Engineer**: Conduct testing at each milestone.  
- **Tools**:
  - **Version Control**: Git (hosted on GitHub/GitLab).  
  - **Task Management**: Jira, Trello, or ClickUp.  
  - **Communication**: Slack, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams.  

---

#### **8. Create a Risk Mitigation Plan**
**Goal**: Identify and address potential risks.  
- **Performance Issues**: Use Redis caching and optimize database queries.  
- **Security Risks**: Employ encryption (HTTPS, JWT), regular security audits.  
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features for the first release.  

---

#### **9. Finalize Timeline and Budget**
**Goal**: Define realistic deadlines and cost estimates.  
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks for MVP.  
- **Budget**:
  - Development costs (developer salaries or outsourcing).  
  - Tool subscriptions (e.g., AWS, design tools).  
  - Marketing for launch campaigns.
