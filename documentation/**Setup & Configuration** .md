**Branch**: `ci/deployment-pipeline`  
**Key Tasks**:
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.  
- Deploy to staging on `develop` branch merges.  
- Deploy to production on `main` branch merges.  

#### **Code Implementation**
```yaml
name: Deployment Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build Docker Images
        run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

      - name: Push to Docker Hub
        env:
          DOCKER_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          DOCKER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
        run: |
          echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME --password-stdin
          docker push your-repo/user-service:latest

      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        env:
          KUBECONFIG: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}
        run: kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
```

#### **Key Developer Notes**:
- **Branch-Based Deployment**:
  - `develop`: Deploy to staging.  
  - `main`: Deploy to production.  
- **Security**:
  - Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive credentials.  
- **Build Optimization**:
  - Cache dependencies and frequently used layers for faster builds.

### **19. Task: Monitor Deployment Performance**

#### **Workflow Configuration**
**Branch**: `feature/monitoring-setup`  
**Key Tasks**:
- Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application metrics.  
- Configure alerts for downtime, high latency, or errors.  

#### **Code Implementation**
**Prometheus Configuration**:
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'user-service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['user-service:3000']
```

**Grafana Dashboard**:
- Add panels for CPU usage, memory consumption, and API response times.  

#### **Key Developer Notes**:
- **Metrics to Monitor**:
  - Application uptime and availability.  
  - API latency and error rates.  
  - Resource usage (CPU, memory).  
- **Alerting**:
  - Configure email or Slack notifications for critical issues.

### **20. Task: Validate Production Readiness**

#### **Workflow Configuration**
**Branch**: `release/validation`  
**Key Tasks**:
- Perform load testing to evaluate performance under heavy traffic.  
- Verify security compliance (e.g., HTTPS, encrypted credentials).  
- Conduct final user acceptance testing (UAT).  

#### **Code Implementation**
**Load Testing Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting Load Test..."
for i in {1..1000}; do
  curl -X POST https://your-app.com/api/register -d "email=test$i@example.com&password=123456"
done
echo "Load Test Completed!"
```

#### **Key Developer Notes**:
- **Performance Benchmark**:
  - Ensure the system handles expected peak loads.  
  - Optimize any bottlenecks identified during testing.  
- **Security Audit**:
  - Validate compliance with GDPR/CCPA for user data handling.  
  - Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
