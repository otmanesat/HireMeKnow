I need help designing a comprehensive software architecture for a mobile job application platform. Here are the key requirements:

1. Application Overview:
- Mobile app for job seekers to:
  - Upload and submit CVs in PDF format
  - Complete skills/preferences surveys
  - Get matched with relevant job offers
- Need both frontend mobile app and backend services
- Require user authentication and data persistence

2. Please provide detailed recommendations for:
- Overall system architecture (microservices vs monolithic)
- Technology stack selection with justification for:
  - Mobile app framework (considering React Native)
  - Backend framework and API design
  - Database selection and data modeling
  - Authentication system
  - File storage solution for CVs
  - Search/matching algorithm implementation using AI
  - API Gateway if needed
  - Deployment and scaling strategy

3. Specific areas to address:
- How to structure the codebase
- Best practices for security
- How to handle real-time updates
- Performance optimization strategies
- Testing approach
- CI/CD pipeline recommendations
- Monitoring and logging
- Error handling
- Data backup and recovery

4. Additional considerations:
- Scalability requirements
- Maintenance and future extensibility
- Cost optimization
- Compliance with data protection regulations

Please provide a detailed architecture diagram and explanation of each component's role and interaction.
