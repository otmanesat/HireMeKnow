### **Detailed Task List**

#### **1. Setup & Configuration**
1. **Task**: Setup Development Environment  
   - Ensure Docker Compose is correctly configured for local services.  
   - Use consistent Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis versions.  

2. **Task**: Create GitHub Repository and Project Structure  
   - Define a clear folder structure (`/frontend`, `/backend`, `/docs`).  
   - Add `.gitignore` and README files with contribution guidelines.  

3. **Task**: Configure CI/CD Pipeline  
   - Integrate GitHub Actions for automatic testing and deployment.  
   - Define triggers for code pushes and pull requests.

#### **2. Core Backend Development**
1. **Task**: Implement User Service  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Endpoint: `POST /api/register`.  
     - Validation for input fields (email, password).  
     - Password hashing using bcrypt.  
     - JWT token generation with role claims.  

2. **Task**: Build Job Matching Service  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - AI-based recommendations for job seekers.  
     - API endpoint: `GET /api/match?user_id={id}`.  
     - Optimize for performance with query indexing.  

3. **Task**: Create Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Use Keycloak or implement a custom RBAC system.  
     - Assign roles (`Basic Seeker`, `Recruiter`, `Admin`).  
     - Restrict endpoints based on user roles.  

4. **Task**: Design Database Schema  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Define `users`, `jobs`, `applications`, and `roles` tables.  
     - Normalize database relationships.  
     - Use migrations for schema updates.  

---

#### **3. Frontend Development**
1. **Task**: Build Registration Flow  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Multi-step form (user role, profile details).  
     - Validation for each step (e.g., email format).  
     - Use Context API or Redux for state management.  

2. **Task**: Implement Profile Creation Interface  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Allow users to upload CVs (validate file types).  
     - Add input fields for skills, experience, preferences.  
     - Integrate with the `POST /api/profile` endpoint.  

3. **Task**: Create Job Search and Application Features  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Search with filters (location, salary, type).  
     - Integrate `GET /api/jobs`.  
     - Submit applications via `POST /api/apply`.  

---

#### **4. Integration Tasks**
1. **Task**: API Integration with Frontend  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Test endpoints before integration.  
     - Handle API errors gracefully (show user-friendly messages).  
     - Ensure consistent data flow using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).  

2. **Task**: Validate Authentication and Authorization  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Test token-based authentication (login, refresh tokens).  
     - Restrict frontend components based on user roles.  

---

#### **5. Testing and Debugging**
1. **Task**: Unit Testing for Backend Services  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Write tests for service logic (e.g., user creation, job matching).  
     - Achieve >80% code coverage using Jest or similar frameworks.  

2. **Task**: End-to-End Testing for Key Flows  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Use Cypress or Playwright for testing the registration and job application flows.  
     - Simulate real user interactions.  

---

#### **6. Deployment Preparation**
1. **Task**: Dockerize All Microservices  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Create individual `Dockerfile` for each service.  
     - Optimize image sizes using multi-stage builds.  

2. **Task**: Write Deployment Scripts  
   - **Key Points**:  
     - Automate service deployment to a cloud provider (AWS, Azure).  
     - Ensure environment variables are securely managed.

### **Key Considerations for Developers**
1. **Consistency**: Follow coding standards (e.g., linting, TypeScript guidelines).  
2. **Security**: Validate all inputs and use secure authentication mechanisms.  
3. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and API responses.  
4. **Documentation**: Document endpoints, database schemas, and code thoroughly.
