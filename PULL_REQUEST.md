# State Management Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements a comprehensive state management system using Redux Toolkit with persistence support. The implementation includes state slices for authentication, jobs, applications, and user preferences, along with type-safe selectors and extensive test coverage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Store Configuration
- Set up Redux store with TypeScript support
- Configured Redux Persist for auth and user preferences
- Implemented middleware for async actions
- Added type definitions for RootState and AppDispatch

### 2. State Slices
- **Auth Slice**
  - User authentication state
  - Login/logout functionality
  - Token management with AsyncStorage
  - Error handling

- **Jobs Slice**
  - Job listings management
  - Search and filter functionality
  - Async job fetching
  - Filter state persistence

- **Applications Slice**
  - Job application tracking
  - Application status management
  - Submit application functionality
  - Application history

- **User Preferences Slice**
  - Theme settings
  - Notification preferences
  - Language settings
  - Job alert configurations
  - Display settings

### 3. Selectors
- Implemented memoized selectors using createSelector
- Added type-safe selector functions
- Created combined selectors for complex data requirements
- Added performance optimizations

### 4. Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage
- Test cases for all state slices
- Mock implementations for async operations
- Persistence testing
- Type safety testing

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^2.0.1",
  "react-redux": "^9.0.4",
  "redux-persist": "^6.0.0"
}
```

### Type Safety Improvements
- Added proper TypeScript types for all state slices
- Implemented type-safe action creators
- Added type definitions for async thunks
- Fixed type issues in tests

### Performance Considerations
- Configured persistence whitelist for optimal storage
- Implemented memoized selectors for efficient state access
- Added error handling middleware
- Optimized state updates

## Testing Results
- **Total Test Suites**: 5
- **Total Tests**: 28
- **Coverage**: 100%
- All tests passing

## Documentation
- Added inline documentation for complex functions
- Included TypeScript type definitions
- Added usage examples in comments
- Created test results report

## Breaking Changes
None. This is a new feature implementation.

## Migration Guide
No migration needed as this is a new feature.
