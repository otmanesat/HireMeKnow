   - Test memory usage
   - Test load times

## Issues and Resolutions

### Resolved Issues
1. Jest Configuration
   - Issue: Initial TypeScript compatibility
   - Resolution: Updated Jest configuration for proper TS support

2. Navigation Testing
   - Issue: Mock implementation needed
   - Resolution: Implemented proper navigation mocks

3. Environment Variables
   - Issue: Test environment setup
   - Resolution: Created separate test environment configuration

### Pending Improvements
